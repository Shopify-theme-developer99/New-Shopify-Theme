## Shopify Website Documentation – For Smooth & Safe Management ✨

> ✅ **Important Guidance**
> To ensure everything runs perfectly and the design remains consistent across all pages, it's highly recommended that **any changes to the theme code, structure, or layout** be handled by a **qualified developer only**.
> The theme contains deeply integrated customizations — so if something seems unclear or needs an update, just share your request with the team! Everything will be taken care of smoothly and safely 🌿
